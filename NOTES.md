## Took some notes from what I learned in the tutorial

### Landscape:
- You can hold shift while using tools (like sculpt) to inverse them.
  - For example, you don't sculpt a hill but a hole.

### Blueprints
- There are level blueprints
- If you select an object in the level, then go to level blueprint and right click on empty space in event graph, you can add reference to that object.
- Shortcuts:
  - Hold D and press LMB -> Creates Delay node
  - Hold ALT and press LMB on Exec arrow (the white little shit where you drag spaghetti - or how to call it) -> Deletes spaghetti that is connecting two blocks.
  - Hold CTRL and drag Variable into the event graph to automatically GET the vector.
  - Click on blueprint box, and hit CTRL + D, you can duplicate it.
  - Hold D and click LMB to add a delay in blueprint.
  - 

- That dots are called 'pins'. Atleast hey call them 'pins'
- That 'little white shit' is called an execution pin.
- If you double click on node, it will create a separate pin. It is called 'reroute node'
- You can add 'Sequence' to split 1 execution pins into more.

- Get Actor Location is a function, but it does not have execution pin. Then it is called a 'pure function'

- Event Tick is a function
  - It is called every frame

- Blueprint is based on C++

- Using spaces in names of functions, variables, etc. is not a good practice and can often lead to problems. Use 'Pascal Case' (example: `MyVariableName` -> each word starts with uppercase).

- Difference between Print String & Print Text
  - Print String: For debugging. Shows messages in the editor (top-left screen) and output log. Uses colored plain text.
  - Print Text: Same purpose, but supports rich text formatting, localization, and better performance in packaged builds. Preferred for production or multi-language.
  - Use Print String when debugging. Use Print Text when formatting, translating, or shipping.

- Variable Types (I already know most of the basic ones, but its better to write them down):
  - Boolean: True / False
  - Byte: Unsigned 8-bit integer
  - Integer: Whole number
  - Integer64: Whole number but for 64bit architecture, meaning it can be larger
  - Float: A decimal number
  - String Types:
    - Name: Used in tags
    - String: It's a String, in most cases we will use this.
    - Text: Text is mostly used for UI & HUD
  - Vector: Vector is a struct with 3 values: `X, Y, Z`.
  - Rotator: Simmilar to Vector, but there is a limitation from values of `0` to `360`. Beyond that, rotator is going to be invalid.
  - Transform: Transform is a struct, which contains `Vector, Rotator, Vector` (Location, Rotation and Scale)
  - Other:
    - Types: Structure, Interface, Object Types, Enum (Enumeration)
    - Most common: Hit Result, Actor, 

- Structs:
  - You can create a 'struct' (content browser -> new -> blueprints -> structure), then create some variables. Then go to blueprint event graph -> right click -> add -> 'name of structure' -> Options: Break, Make, Set...
  - Struct (name of the structure) can also be a type of variable.
  - If we drag&drop the variable (which has a struct type) and choose 'get', we can right click on the blue pin and decide to 'Split Struct pin'.
  - It's basically a variable which stores multiple variables in it
  - Removing an existing variable from struct can cause issues in blueprints.
  - 

- Enums:
  - You can create 'enum' (content browser -> new -> blueprints -> enumeration).
  - Enumerator is a number between 0 and 256
  - Enum (name of the enumeration) can also be a type of variable.
    - After you assign a enum as a type of variable, you can set Default value of the enum in the variable details (in blueprint).
  - You can assign `Get "VariableName"` to print string (if it's enum).
  - If you drag&drop the variable (which has an enum type) and choose 'get', you can drag a node out of it to create `Switch on "EnumName"` where you can drag more nodes out of it based on enumerations names in your enum.

- Functions:
  - Function is basically a block of code which adds functionality to your program. 
  - You can add input/output parameters for a function in its details panel
  - You can create something called 'Local Variables' in functions.
  - You can not add a delay node in functions.

- Macros:
  - You can not add a delay node in functions. That's why we use macros

### Misc
- You can hit 'end' on your keyboard to snap items to the ground (landscape) in the level.
- Anything that can be placed in a level is called an 'Actor'
- Light Movability:
  - Types can be changed in Transform section in the details panel
  - Types of Light Movability:
    - Static: Can't be changed in-game
    - Stationary: Can only change color and intensity in-game, but cant move
    - Movable: Can be moved and changed in-game
