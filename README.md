Reason: Axis and Action mappings are now deprecated, please use Enhanced Input Action and Input Mapping Contexts instead.<br />
I don't fucking remember from school what to do. I'm going to sleep, I'm tired

so, a quick note: i switched from UE 5.4 to 5.6 because of some new features and because i cant really fit 2 different versions on my school pc.<br />
also, talking about the input problems i had like 4 months ago when i decided to end with unreal just because of that, i kindof locked in and im gonna fix that when i find time for it (pretty soon)
